AWS Security Hub Automated Response and Remediation is an add-on solution that
enables AWS Security Hub customers to remediate security findings with a 
single click using predefined response and remediation actions packaged in 
“Playbooks”. This Playbook, NEWPLAYBOOK, is an example customers can use to
create custom playbooks. It is not deployable without modification. Please
see the AWS Security Hub Automated Response and Remediation Implementation 
Guide for more information.
